\title{Risk Assessment Plot.}
\usage{
raplot(x1, x2, y)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Calculated probabilities (eg through a logistic regression model) of the reference (null) model.  Must be between 0 & 1}

\item{x2}{Calculated probabilities (eg through a logistic regression model) of the new (alternative) model.   Must be between 0 & 1}

\item{y}{Binary of outcome of interest. Must be 0 or 1.}
}
\value{
A list is returned with the following items:
\item{Null.p.sens}{The horizontal axis coordinates (calculated probablities) for the sensitivity of the reference (null) model}
 \item{Null.sens}{The vertical axis coordinates (sensitivities) of the reference (null) model}
  \item{Null.p.1spec}{The horizontal axis coordinates (calculated probablities) for 1-specificity of the reference (null) model}
   \item{Null.1spec}{The vertical axis coordinates (1-specificities) of the reference (null) model}
\item{Alt.p.sens}{The horizontal axis coordinates (calculated probablities) for the sensitivity of the new (alternative) model}
 \item{Alt.sens}{The vertical axis coordinates (sensitivities) of the new (alternative) model}
  \item{Alt.p.1spec}{The horizontal axis coordinates (calculated probablities) for 1-specificity of the new (alternative) model}
   \item{Alt.1spec}{The vertical axis coordinates (1-specificities) of the new (alternative) model}
}
\description{
The function raplots plots the Sensitivity and 1-Specificity curves against the calculated risk for the null (reference) and alternative (new) models, thus graphically displaying the IDIs for those with and without the events.  These plots can aid interpretation of the NRI and IDI metrics.
