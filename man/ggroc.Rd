\usage{
ggroc(
  x1,
  x2 = NULL,
  y = NULL,
  carrington_line = FALSE,
  costs = c(0, 0, 1, 1),
  label_number = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Either a logistic regression fitted using glm (base package) or lrm (rms package) or alculated probabilities (eg through a logistic regression model) of the baseline model.  Must be between 0 & 1}

\item{x2}{Either a logistic regression fitted using glm (base package) or lrm (rms package) or calculated probabilities (eg through a logistic regression model) of the new (alternative) model.   Must be between 0 & 1}

\item{y}{Binary of outcome of interest. Must be 0 or 1 (if fitted models are provided this is extracted from the fit which for an rms fit must have x = TRUE, y = TRUE).}

\item{carrington_line}{The Useful Area is from the roc down to this line. It depends on prevalence and the costs of FP, FN, TP, TN.  Default is FALSE. See Carrington et al.}

\item{costs}{Numeric vectors costs = c(cFP, cFN,cTP, cTN). The costs of FP, FN, TP, TN.  Default, c(0,0,1,1), is for there to be no costs for the FP & FN and identical costs for TN and TP.  See Carrington et al.}

\item{label_number}{The number of points on the curve to label.The default has no labels.}
