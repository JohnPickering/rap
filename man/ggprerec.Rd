\title{The Precision-Recall plot}
\usage{
ggprerec(x1, x2 = NULL, y = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x1}{Either a logistic regression fitted using glm (base package) or lrm (rms package) or alculated probabilities (eg through a logistic regression model) of the baseline model.  Must be between 0 & 1}

\item{x2}{Either a logistic regression fitted using glm (base package) or lrm (rms package) or calculated probabilities (eg through a logistic regression model) of the new (alternative) model.   Must be between 0 & 1}

\item{y}{Binary of outcome of interest. Must be 0 or 1 (if fitted models are provided this is extracted from the fit which for an rms fit must have x = TRUE, y = TRUE).}
